### Consider Pin behavior

* If `Consider Pin` is checked, the behavior of arrange remains the same as before, i.e. pinned element do not move or change size.
* If `Consider Pin` is not checked, the behavior of arrange is the same as when all the elements are unpinned.

### Arrange Linked Border Nodes of the Selection behavior

The behavior is the same as `Arrange Linked Border Nodes` but with a different scope. The scope is all ports of all selected element.

For example in this diagram, if B is selected (in blue here), the port in green is arranged (1 port):
!arrange_border_node_selection1.png!

And if we add D to the selection (in blue here), the ports in green are arranged (5 ports):
!arrange_border_node_selection2.png!

If port is pinned and `Consider Pin` is checked, the port is not arranged.
