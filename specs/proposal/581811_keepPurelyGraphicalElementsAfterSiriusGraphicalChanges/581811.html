			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
		<p>In Sirius, there are 4 "graphical elements without semantic link". These concepts are purely graphical, they have no effect on the semantic model and the semantic model has no impact on them. In the rest of the specification, we talk about "purely graphical elements" for these concepts. All the tools allowing to create them are grouped in the same drop-down menu in the palette:</p>
		<p>
			<img alt="Palette" title="Palette" border="0" src="images/palette.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The notes, the representation links and the texts can be created on the diagram or in a container.
			The note attachments link a purely graphical element (a 
			<code>Note</code>, a 
			<code>Representation Link</code>, a 
			<code>Text</code> or another 
			<code>Note Attachment</code>) to another object. This object is most of the time a Sirius graphical element, which correspond to a semantic element. But it can also be another purely graphical element.
		</p>
		<p>After some change on the diagram, some "graphical elements without semantic link" can be lost without obvious reason for the end-user. Technically, these elements are sometimes removed because the original annotated Sirius graphical element has been removed. But according to the end-user, the Sirius graphical element is the same (even if technically, this is a new one, created by the Sirius refresh mechanism).</p>
		<p>The below example is a simple case to clarify the problem.</p>
		<p>
			<img alt="Simple sample before drag&apos;n&apos;drop" title="Simple sample before drag&apos;n&apos;drop" border="0" src="images/SimpleSample-1-beforeDnD.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The above diagram is a sample before doing a drag'n'drop of "Class1" from the container "packageA" to the diagram.</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The "packageA" and "Class1" are Sirius graphical elements, with respectively a link with semantic elements "packageA" and "Class1".</li>
			<li>The "NoteOnNode" is a purely graphical concept, a 
				<code>Note</code>.
			</li>
			<li>The link between "NoteOnNode" and "Class1" is a 
				<code>NoteAttachment</code>.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			<img alt="Simple sample after drag&apos;n&apos;drop" title="Simple sample after drag&apos;n&apos;drop" border="0" src="images/SimpleSample-2-afterDnD.png"/>
		</p>
		<p>The above diagram is the current result after doing the drag'n'drop of "Class1" from the container "packageA" to the diagram. As you can see, the link between "NoteOnNode" and "Class1" has been lost. This is a typical sample of problem that this feature must resolve.</p>
		<h2 id="detailed-specification">Detailed Specification</h2>
		<p>When you perform certain actions on a diagram, multiple refreshes are technically involved:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Firstly, the executed tool makes semantic changes (according to what has been coded in your modeler).</li>
			<li>Then, a Sirius refresh is called to (re)compute the Sirius graphical elements to display in the diagram (called 
				<code>DDiagramElement</code>), according to the semantic elements state.
			</li>
			<li>Then, the GMF nodes and edges are refreshed according to Sirius graphical elements. The GMF nodes are somehow the link between the Sirius graphical elements and the corresponding "figures" drawn in the diagram.</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The purely graphical elements only exist on the "GMF nodes and edges layer". In the above simple sample:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The tool moves the "Class1" from "packageA" to container of "packageA", ie the semantic package associated to the diagram.</li>
			<li>The Sirius refresh identifies that the semantic element "is the same" and reuses the existing DDiagramElement.</li>
			<li>But at the "GMF nodes and edges layer", a new node is created and the original node, at which the Note was connected, no longer exists. So the note attachment is removed during the "GMF nodes and edges refresh".</li>
		</ul>
		<p>Only scenarios described bellow will be handled by this feature request. Indeed, the refresh mechanism is complex. It can be "amended" by specific extension point. For this reason, there is no guarantee that a scenario not explained here will be covered.</p>
		<p>Globally, the goal is to keep the purely graphical elements if after the tool execution, we are able to find one, and only one, GMF created node with the same DDiagramElement or with the same semantic element, than the after original linked element.</p>
		<p>All the below scenarios used data available in
