* "Bug 534301 - Improve Sirius Popup Menu contributions":https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=534301

h2. Introduction

The bugzilla "534301"::https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=534301 is the POC of this current evolution. It only concerns diagram popup menu. Another issue exists, "bugzilla 535946":https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=535946, to merge:
* the core concept of @PopupMenu@ declared in the viewpoint.ecore meta-model and used in diagram representation
* and the tree concept @TreePopupMenu@ declared in the tree.ecore meta-model and used in tree representation

The new features covered by this evolution are:
* capability to contribute a group in an existing diagram menu or in menu contributed in your modeler. It will be also possible to contribute menus (@Popup Menu@) or actions (@Operation Action@) in this group. For the UI aspect, a separator line is drawn between each group. 

Sample of menu contributions with group:

* capability to contribute a group in the drop-down menus of the tabbar. Only "Select All" drop-down will be handled in this evolution.

Sample of tabbar contributions:

* document the list of all IDs of existing menus and groups in contextual menu of a diagram. This documentation is necessary to facilitate the locate group in existing menu.

h2. Detailed Specification

h3. Group notion in meta-model

The notion of @Group@ will be added in the meta-model.
As @PopupMenu@, a @Group@ can be added in a tool section of a diagram.
As @PopupMenu@, the properties @elementsToSelect@ and @inverseSelectionOrder@ will be filtered in the UI (in the Properties view).
A @Group@ can contain 0 or multiple @PopupMenu@. A @Group@ can contain 0 or multiple @MenuItemDescription@ (ie actions).
A @Group@ has an id (the field @name@ inherited from @IdentifiedElement@). It also has a @label@, but the field is not mandatory and not really used.
A @Group@ has a @locationURI@: an URI specification that defines the insertion point at which the group will be added.
The format for the URI is comprised of two basic parts:
* Scheme: One of "menu", "tabbar". Indicates the type of the manager used to handle the contributions.
* Id: This is either the id of an existing menu or tabbar menu
We can imagine a third part: Query - This field allows fine-grained definition of the specific location within a given menu. It has the form "[placement]=[id]" where placement is one of "before", "after", or "endof" and the id is expected to be the id of another contribution in the menu. This third part is not in the scope of this evolution.
A @Group@ can be added as a child of a @PopupMenu@. In this context, the @locationURI@ must be null.

h3. Technical changes

Here is a list of some technical necessary changes detected during the specification:
* @org.eclipse.sirius.editor.properties.filters.tool.abstracttool.AbstractToolDescriptionElementsToSelectFilterSpec@ and @org.eclipse.sirius.editor.properties.filters.tool.abstracttool.AbstractToolDescriptionInverseSelectionOrderFilterSpec@ to filter the properties @elementsToSelect@ and @inverseSelectionOrder@ in the Properties view.
* @org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.description.tool.provider.ToolGroupItemProvider.collectNewChildDescriptors(Collection<Object>, Object)@: To remove the @Group@ creation menu from the @ToolGroup@.
* @org.eclipse.sirius.diagram.ui.tools.internal.menu.PopupMenuContribution@: To replace all the code from the POC with the new concept of @Group@
* @org.eclipse.sirius.editor.tools.internal.menu.child.MenuToolsMenuBuilder@: To add the @Group@ in first position of the "New Menu" menu on a @Tool Section@.

h2. Backward Compatibility and Migration Paths

This evolution does not change any API. It adds new APIs allowing the capability to define @Group@ in the VSM file. 

h3. User Interface Changes

For the specifier, the "New Menu" menu on a @Tool Section@ displays the @Group@ in first:

h3. Documentation Changes

A note will be added in the New and Noteworthy.
A chapter will be added in the _Sirius Specifier Manual_ near the _Popup Menu_ "chapter":https://www.eclipse.org/sirius/doc/specifier/diagrams/Diagrams.html#popup_menu in _Tools_ section. 

h2. Tests and Non-regression strategy

* Group with blank locationURI
* Group in an existing menu (default location)
* Group at the same place of an existing group of an existing menu (to insert action in the existing group)
* Group in a PopupMenu contributed by Sirius through the VSM
* Group in Select All menu of the tabbar
* PopupMenu contributed by Sirius through the VSM in a Group
